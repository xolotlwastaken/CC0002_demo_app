# 🤔 Which Deployment Method Should I Use?

## TL;DR

- **Want simplicity?** → Use **Monorepo** (deploy both together)
- **Want flexibility?** → Use **Separate Projects** (deploy independently)
- **Not sure?** → Start with **Monorepo**, migrate later if needed

## 🎯 Monorepo Deployment (Recommended for Students)

### ✅ Advantages

- **One URL to share**: `https://ntu-planner.vercel.app`
- **No CORS configuration**: Same origin
- **Simpler management**: One project, one dashboard
- **Perfect for demos**: Easy to show your work
- **Easier to understand**: Everything in one place

### ❌ Disadvantages

- **Slower deploys**: Rebuilds both even if only one changed
- **Less flexible**: Can't scale API independently
- **Shared resources**: Both use same serverless quotas

### 🎓 Best For:

- Student projects
- Prototypes and MVPs
- Demos and presentations
- Single developer teams
- Learning and experimentation

## 🏢 Separate Projects Deployment

### ✅ Advantages

- **Independent scaling**: API and frontend scale separately
- **Faster deploys**: Only rebuild what changed
- **Better organization**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Flexible domains**: Different URLs for API vs frontend
- **Team-friendly**: Different teams can own each part

### ❌ Disadvantages

- **More setup**: Two projects to configure
- **CORS required**: Must handle cross-origin requests
- **More maintenance**: Two dashboards to manage
- **Two URLs**: Need to remember both

### 🏢 Best For:

- Production applications
- Team projects
- High-traffic apps
- Microservices architecture
- Apps needing independent scaling

## 🔄 Migration Path

### From Monorepo → Separate Projects

**When to migrate:**
- App becomes popular (high traffic)
- Need to scale API independently
- Different teams manage frontend/backend
- API serves multiple frontends

**How:**
1. Deploy API as separate project
2. Update `VITE_API_URL` in frontend
3. Remove `api/` folder from monorepo
4. Redeploy frontend

### From Separate → Monorepo

**When to migrate:**
- Tired of managing two projects
- Want simpler deployment
- Don't need independent scaling
- Reduce CORS complexity

**How:**
1. Copy API code to `apps/api`
2. Create `api/serverless.js` wrapper
3. Add `vercel.json` configuration
4. Update frontend API URL
5. Deploy as monorepo

## 💡 My Recommendation

### For This Project: **Monorepo** 🎯

**Why?**
1. You're likely a student (NTU course planner)
2. This is a demo/portfolio project
3. Simpler to show in presentations
4. No CORS headaches
5. One URL to remember and share

**When to switch to Separate:**
- You get 1000+ daily users
- API serves multiple clients
- You add more features (mobile app, etc.)
- You need API caching/CDN
- Team grows beyond 1-2 people

# Deploy Frontend (in new terminal)
cd apps/web
vercel env add VITE_API_URL
vercel --prod
```
